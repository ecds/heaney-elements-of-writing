Paradoxically, earth is the most familiar element for SH - describes himself as sedimentary â€“ and yet it is the element that provides the most effective distancing mechanism for confronting the difficult material of the Troubles and his own times. The process of unearthing poems (and buried bodies) mirrors his creative process and his self-refective engagement with this archaeological impulse. "Digging deep" opens a pathway to complex layers of history and of the self for Heaney as he navigates the parallels be finds between ancient rituals of tribal sacrifice and the brutal violence of contemporary times..

["Summer 1969": Include discussion of Goya? See RL on this poem

The final image is that of "that holmgang / Where two berserks club each other to death / For honour's sake, greaved in a bog, and sinking". These complex and powerful images allude to the cycle of death, revenge, and violence that is going on in Northern Ireland at the time that Heaney was in Spain. ]
