One further stanza found in the drafts of 'Punishment,' powerfully connects the two female bog bodies under discussion here. In an excised stanza, Heaney writes:

Into your meek gaze

I commit the stone-casters

And your punished sisters

Weeping under the lamp-post. [Link to Haydon Murphy Broadsheet]

Echoing the lines spoken by Christ _in extremis_, "Father, into your hands, I commit my spirit," Heaney here consigns the perpetrators and the punished into the "meek gaze" of the ancient

girl.[^31]

Heaney deletes this stanza from 'Punishment' but the concept of the gaze becomes the central trope of the next poem in _North_, 'Strange Fruit' (_N_ 32_)_. At first, this sonnet seems to retreat from any contemporary context back into the museum with the explicit language of display, "Here is the girl's head like an exhumed gourd". [Link to Glob Photo]Organic similes, like those used in the 'The Grauballe Man', vie with descriptions of the head as a valuable object, "perishable treasure" that will literally be "made an exhibition of". In the octet, the girl's head is viewed and forensically examined by the speaker, but she does not look back – even her eyeholes are described as "blank as pools in the old workings." [Link to Toome print]

The proximity between the speaker and the girl is displaced in the sestet by the broader historical context of her murder, recording "the gradual ease" of Greek historian, Diodorus Siculus with "the likes of this."[^32] The estrangement promised by the title comes not by considering the barbaric circumstances of the girl's death, but in the speaker's awareness of his own tendency to worship her severed head. The relentless list of adjectives describing her plight, "Murdered, forgotten, nameless, terrible/Beheaded girl," are laid before her, as if in atonement, but fall short before her restored gaze. Repeating the word "outstaring," Heaney grants the girl the power to challenge the violence of her executioners and the devotion offered by the poet-speaker in his artful transformation of her fate. These lines adjust the problematic male gaze or voyeurism of 'Punishment' to allow for the silent rebuke of this unseeing female stare, "outstaring axe/And beatification, outstaring/What had begun to feel like reverence." Helen Vendler describes this (uncanny) encounter like "an uninterpretable residue or some other form of art beyond mimetic representation," (Vendler, pg 48) suggesting the unsettling effect of the girl's gaze on the speaker and the reader. Unsettling too is the interjection of the contemporary context of the poem's title, 'Strange Fruit,' into this poetic contemplation of the ancient body.

This title conjures up the lynched black bodies hanging from the 'southern trees' of Abel Meeropol's song 'Strange Fruit' made famous by Billie Holiday in 1939. In her examination of the drafts of the poem, Gail McConnell points out that Meeropol himself had been 'haunted for days' by a photograph of a lynching[^33] in which the bodies of two black men hang from trees above a crowd of white spectators. (McConnell, 432). This is the only one of the bog poems to evoke a contemporary comparative framework outside of Ireland and the only one to suggest racialized (as opposed to gender) violence.

The manuscript drafts of the poem show that the poem was originally entitled 'Triceps', then 'Reliquary', then 'My Reverence' and seemingly finally, 'Tête coupée'.[^34]

In composing the poem, Heaney gradually removes specific references to Catholic relics and beliefs; Oliver Plunkett[^35], the martyr whose head is on display in St. Peter's Church in Drogheda [link to photo]; "Veronica's napkin," the cloth relic named after the woman who wiped the face of Jesus as he carried the cross; "exposition," in which the girl's head functions as a synecdoche for the body of Christ. These Catholic relics are relegated from the drafts alongside references to earlier pre-Christian or Celtic practices as Heaney tightens his focus on the severed head itself and the unseeing stare of the beheaded girl. The religious residue remains however in the working titles, 'Reliquary,' and 'My Reverence,' the latter foregrounding the worshipful attitude of the speaker. McConnell rightly argues that such changes reveal Heaney's attempt to "get at the complex politics of the gaze and the ethics of looking. (McConnell, 435)" Certainly, the final title change – shown in a decisive black line striking through 'Tête coupée' and its replacement by the capitalized, handwritten 'STRANGE FRUIT' – opens up an entirely new field of force and of situational politics. [link to draft] Yet, perhaps because the implied comparison of the ancient head or "exhumed gourd" to the "strange fruit" of black bodies murdered in the early twentieth-century is confined to the title of the poem, it has not attracted the kind of criticism levelled at 'Punishment.' Instead, the critics of 'Punishment' read 'Strange Fruit' as one of the most successful poems in _North_, because in Edna Longley's words, "it questions its own attitude, challenges inevitability." (Longley, 155) Despite her exposure in this poem, the unseeing blank-eyed girl, like the blindfolded figure of Justice, "outstares" the totalizing gaze of the speaker, the reader and the museum visitor and refuses the categories of this "exhibition."

## Notes


[^31]: See BROADSHEET 17, ed Hayden Murphy with printing of Punishment and striking image by John Behan 1973. Variant verse "Into your meek gaze/I commit the stone-casters/and your punished sisters/weeping under the lamp-post." plus lots of other variations. Haven't seen this before - Rand Brandes Heaney papers, Rose Libr. Scan requested (March 08, 2022) Do more with the variations in this version

[^32]: Gail McConnell points out that this reference to Diodorus Siculus comes not from Glob's book, but from Heaney's reading of a frequently overlooked source, Anne Ross's _Everyday Life of the Pagan Celts_ (London, Batsford, 1970), p.155

[^35]: Oliver Plunkett was the last Catholic to be martyred in England in 1681. He was hanged, drawn, and quartered for treason and "promoting the Roman faith." In 1975, he was the first Irish saint to be canonized in almost 700 years. See photo of Oliver Plunkett in the Carlos museum.
