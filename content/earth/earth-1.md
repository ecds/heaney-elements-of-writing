"I have always listened for poems, they come sometimes like bodies come out of a bog, almost complete, seeming to have been laid down a long time ago, surfacing with a touch of mystery." ('Belfast,' _P_ 34)

"They unswaddled the wet fern of her hair
And made an exhibition of its coil." ('Strange Fruit')

Seamus Heaney often said that he became a writer when his roots crossed with his reading, a casual example of the archaeological theme, accessible but multi-layered, that connects him to the earth as his natural element. The earliest reviews of his work describe how Heaney's words give us "the soil-reek of Ireland," [^1] in poems "loud with the slap of the spade and sour with the stink of turned earth."[^2] Even the terms most often used to describe Heaney -- 'down to earth' and 'grounded'[^3] -- evoke this element, as do Heaney's own descriptions of his early poetry as "a dig for finds" (_P_ 41), "earth-hugging" and "sedimentary". [Link to photo of SH in bog]Heaney's interest in his home ground expanded almost immediately from the local landscape, "Toner's Bog in Bellaghy parish"(_SS_ 98) to the matter of bogland in general to the "opened ground" of pre-Christian Europe. As Heaney said, "The material kept promising because of its intimacy with the very land that I grew up in. I could feel this in my nostrils, the feeling of a bog. And a lot of those poems…they come out of my intimacy with the bog as a domain…" [^4] 

From 'Bogland' through 'The Tollund Man' [^5] to the bog poems collected in _North_, Heaney extends his claim on the bog as his domain, staking out his poetic territory in material, mythological, and metaphorical terms. Indeed, he describes this period as one in which he was "treading earth" (_SS_ 157) and later wrote, "Out of that earth-house, I inherited/A stack of singular cold memory-weights/To load me, hand and foot, in the scale of things.('Squarings xl')"As he said of his devotion to the myth of Antaeus and Hercules in a speech delivered on RTE in celebration of his seventieth birthday [Integrate better]:

In Greek mythology, Antaeus was a giant who was born out of the earth and who consequently derived all his strength and prowess from contact with the earth. . . I identified with this earthman because I saw myself as something of an earthman, somebody with his poetic feet very much on the local ground . . . I regarded Antaeus as something of a guardian spirit, an emblem of whatever poetic gift I might have. But at the same time I was also aware that Antaeus, for all his strength, was far from invulnerable; I knew indeed that he would be defeated in the end by another hero, the mighty Hercules.[^6]

Heaney's visceral, organic connection to the bog as his home ground and the galvanizing effect of Danish archaeologist, P.V. Glob's book, _The Bog People_ have rightly dominated discussions of this intensely fruitful turn in Heaney's work.Inspired by Glob's arresting photographs and descriptions of Iron age victims of ritual sacrifice, Heaney wrote a series of poems comparing these ancient acts of violence with current atrocities in the Northern Irish troubles.[Link to Glob photos] In these poems, the bog becomes not just an agent of preservation, yielding up indiscriminate objects, but a repository of human remains and the symbol of a savage history that refuses to remain buried.

Focusing on two pairs of poems that engage with ancient bodies discovered in bogs in Northern Europe, I argue that the bog becomes for Heaney an underground museum or archive of a pre-Christian, pre-colonial past. In poems that juxtapose tribal sacrifice in ancient Jutland with acts of violence in contemporary Ireland, Heaney interrogates the ethics of viewing these human victims as they become museum pieces. In 'The Tollund Man', Heaney vows to visit the exhibited body in response to Glob's photograph of the head in repose; 'The Grauballe Man' is doubly viewed as a photograph and museum piece and also compared to the Roman sculpture of the 'Dying Gaul'. These male bodies, identified by the location in which they were found, set up the imagined continuity between ancient rituals of sacrifice to the fertility goddess, Nerthus, in Jutland and acts of atrocity in modern Ireland. Such violence is more explicitly rendered in two of the poems about female bodies, particularly 'Punishment', but also in its companion poem, 'Strange Fruit'. These poems engage in written form with visual images of the bog bodies on display - either in photographs or in museums – and with the speaker's own response to these exhibited human artifacts. In each case, moments of rupture occur when references to contemporary violence break through the speaker's controlled aestheticized contemplation of the ancient bodies. In fact, it is through considering exhibition as a form of representation that the power of these poems to address violence in the past and present is revealed.

Heaney's poem 'Bogland' (_DD_, 55) initiates his exploration of the bog as "the memory of the landscape, or as a landscape that remember[s] everything that happened in and to it" (_P,_ 54). [Link to draft of Bogland] The opening line, "We have no prairies/To slice a big sun at evening," adopts a collective voice and opens a comparative vein (here, between Ireland and America) that will characterize all the bog poems. The viewpoint of the speaker and the gaze of the reader veers from the imagined horizon of the prairies intersecting the sun, down to the earth of the encrusted bog. As Heaney said, "I think that I am basically a ground person, you know, if it came to which element... I am sedimentary. That comes out earlier on, I think with poems like _Bog Land_, which is about going down and down and finding origin there."[^7] Heaney, like the "pioneers," he invokes in the poem, digs "inwards and downwards," excavating the bog as a liquid landscape that preserves everything from the grandeur of the "great Irish elk" [Barrie Cooke painting]to the domesticity of butter sunk underground a hundred years ago. Heaney sees history as a palimpsest, incompletely erased and legible in the remembering ground of the bog itself. The poem's pioneers are archaeologists of a landscape in which "Every layer they strip/Seems camped on before." (_DD_, 55)

Heaney dedicated 'Bogland' to his friend, the painter T.P. (Terry) Flanagan. Recalling a visit to the boglands of Donegal with his friend in 1968, Heaney contrasts their approaches to the bog as a landscape, "Terry was very much a visual, painterly reactor. I don't think he had much politico-historico interest in it as an image"[^8] Indeed, Flanagan's bog paintings dwell on what Heaney called the "flirtation" of light and water on the surface of the landscape, mutating into abstract shapes and patterns. [~~Link to Flanagan painting~~] In contrast, Heaney is interested in the things that come out of the bog, from humble material objects to Viking gold to human remains. For Heaney, the bog is both repository and reliquary, "yielding" its treasures in material and creative terms.

Recalling his sense of discovery when he began writing the first of his bog body poems, 'The Tollund Man' (_WO_, 47), Heaney said, "The minute I wrote 'Some day I will go to Aarhus' I was in a new field of force. It had to do with the aura surrounding that head -- even in a photograph. It was uncanny in the full technical sense." (SS pg? ) [Link to photo of Tollund Man head]In her discussion of Heaney and the photograph,Gail McConnell points out that Glob's book has been considered primarily as a textual rather than visual source for Heaney's bog poems, despite the fact that over half of the pages (64 out of 116) in _The Bog People_ are photographs.[^9] She quotes Edna Longley's observation that "many of Heaney's comments on poetry 'nudge it towards the visual arts . . . "the verbal icon"; "a search for images and symbols"; "The poetry I love is some kind of image or visionary thing", "a painter can lift anything and make an image of it."'[^10] Moving from the painterly to the photographic,Amanda Sperry[^11] emphasizes the mediated nature of Heaney's engagement with the bog bodies in his poems, all (except 'The Bog Queen') reposing in museums in Northern Europe. However, what McConnell and Sperry describe as an encounter with photography and with photographic composition might also be described as a concern with "exhibition" or exposure and, ultimately, with the ethics of looking.[^12] In fact, Melanie Giles opens her account of the bog bodies as "disquieting exhibits" with an epigraph from Heaney's essay on 'The Man and the Bog.'[^13]

Once upon a time, these heads and limbs existed in order to express and embody the needs and impulses of an individual human life. They were the vehicles of different biographies and they compelled singular attention, they proclaimed 'I am I'. Even when they were first dead, at the moment of their sacrifice or atrocity, their bodies and their limbs manifested biography and conserved vestiges of personal identity: they were corpses. But when a corpse becomes a bog body, the personal identity drops away; the bog body does not proclaim 'I am I'; instead it says something like 'I am it' or 'I am you'. Like the work of art the bog body asks to be contemplated; it eludes the biographical and enters the realm of the aesthetic.[^14]
