Much attention has been paid to Heaney's own commentary on the political context of the bog poems and on their relevance to the violence of the 1970s. In one of his earliest interviews in 1977, Heaney talked about how his poetic "instinctive energies" were more engaged by the images in Glob's book than by the atrocities happening outside his own front door:

My emotions, my feelings, whatever those instinctive energies are that have to be engaged for a poem, those energies quickened more when contemplating a victim, strangely, from 2000 years ago than they did from contemplating a man at the end of a road being swept up into a plastic bag -- I mean the barman at the end of our road tried to carry out a bomb and it blew up. Now there is of course something terrible about that, but somehow language, words didn't live in the way I think they have to live in a poem when they were hovering over that kind of horror and pity.
[^36]

For the most part, critics have followed Heaney's lead in looking away from the contemporary violence at the ancient victims recovered from the bog and revivified in his poems. Yet this statement is most notable for the way it registers the shock of the local barman "being swept up into a plastic bag."
[^37]
 All the energy in the passage is about the horror of the contemporary incident, not the 2000 year old bodies. Notably, in early drafts of 'Funeral Rites' from _North,_ Heaney includes much more explicit references to "men whose blown stomachs were cleaned like dung/into eight plastic bags" (Version 1), "men whose blown stomachs were cleaned like dung/Off the pavements" (Version 2), and "shovelled remnants" (Version 3)
[^38]
 but as Michael Parker points out, the final version of the poem directs "its metaphoric and mythic energies towards some future rituals of atonement and reconciliation."
[^39]

In fact, this particular incident became something of a trigger for Heaney, appearing in several early interviews and finally in the elegiac poem 'Route 110,' from his last volume, _Human Chain_, "And what in the end was there left to bury/Of Mr. Lavery, blown up in his own pub/As he bore the primed device and bears it still/Mid-morning towards the sun-admitting door/Of Ashley House?" (_HC_) The endless time-loop of Mr Lavery carrying the primed device in his last moments ("and bears it still") recurs as a traumatic memory for Heaney.

The incident is first mentioned in a piece by Bernard Weinraur in the _New York Times_ in May 1972 called "Belfast: Terror in a Time of Troubles."
[^40]
The article opens with a description of the recent explosion of a 100 pound bomb and the response of various figures in Belfast associated with the arts and culture including Seamus Heaney, "the city's best-known poet," who heard the blast and "looked up from his desk." In the piece, Heaney describes Northern Ireland as an "anachronistic and primitive place with tremendous ritual and delicate taboos," a place in which the troubles have "formed people's personalities and psychologies". Asked more specifically about how to respond to the violence, Heaney replied, "When I write it's not to heal the situation, but myself. What I want to do is explore, rather than propound. I want to tell my own secrets."He goes on to discuss the death of the barman on his street, "A man was blown to pieces on the corner recently," [Heaney] said. "You want to do something, say something, but you feel impotent. I wrote a poem about lying awake at night and listening to the bombs. But, you see, I'm interested in memories, intimacies." Even here, speaking to a journalist in the midst of the terror, Heaney's instinct is to deflect attention away from the specificities and to guard his right to his interior life and poetic subject matter.

In contrast, Heaney's description of the importance of Glob's book in his first major critical essay, 'Feeling into Words,' is much more controlled, "And the unforgettable photographs of these victims blended in my mind with photographs of atrocities, past and present, in the long rites of Irish political and religious struggles". (_P_ 57-8) The bog poems not only "blend" these photographic images into poetic language but also displace and distance the atrocities Heaney witnesses outside his own front door. Again, discussing the most controversial bog poem, 'Punishment,' in 1997, Heaney says, "Its concerns are immediate and contemporary, but for some reason I couldn't bring army barracks or police barracks or Bogside street life into the language and topography of the poem. I found it more convincing to write about the bodies in the bog and the vision of Iron Age punishment. Pressure seemed to drain away from the writing if I shifted my focus from those images."
[^41]
 Despite Heaney's insistence on his personal aesthetic need to 'take his distance' from the immediate situation, his critics accused him of mythologising or aestheticising violence.

This critique was most forcefully voiced by Ciaran Carson in his review of _North_ in _The Honest Ulsterman_ in 1975, in which he claimed that Heaney was in danger of becoming 'the laureate of violence â€“ a mythmaker, an anthropologist of ritual killing, an apologist for "the situation", in the last resort, a mystifier'.
[^42]
[Link to Carson review]This indictment obscures another scathing comment in the same review, "[e]veryone was anxious that _North_ should be a great book; when it turned out that it wasn't, it was treated as one anyway, and made into an Ulster '75 Exhibition of the Good that can come out of Troubled Times." Together with his assessment of Edward McGuire's portrait of Heaney [link to portrait] on the back cover of _North_ as "idealized almost to the point of caricature," and his contention that Heaney has "acquired the status of myth, of institution," Carson's 'Ulster '75 Exhibition' showcases Heaney himself as the prime exhibit on display. What Heaney 'represents' is harder to gauge although the final quip that "Heaney is too good and too sensible a poet to turn into Faber's answer to Georgie Best'' suggests that Carson's objections have as much to do with the marketing and commercialisation of Heaney as the representative poet of the Troubles as with the poems under review. Carson recoils from the idea that the suffering caused by the Troubles might be repackaged as poetry that is redemptive or consolatory by Heaney's London-based publishing firm, a concern shared by Heaney in his own rejection of "the good news brigade" and the question posed in 'Stump,' "What do I say if they wheel out their dead?"(WO)

Carson's acerbic invention of an exhibition of "the Good that can come out of Troubled Times," speaks to the earlier line in his review in which he claims that Heaney is in danger of becoming the"laureate of violence." This anxiety about the representation of the Troubles (shared by many if not all of Carson's fellow poets) is of course discernible in the bog poems themselves, often in language that interrogates the problems of exhibiting or exposing these ancient bodies.
