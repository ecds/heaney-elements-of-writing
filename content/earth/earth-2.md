The distances, temporal and geographical, between speaker and bog body in 'The Tollund Man' are tightly controlled by Heaney in what Helen Vendler calls a "binocular view of the past and present." (Vendler, 42) The collective 'we' of 'Bogland' becomes the 'I' of Heaney's personal vow to make a pilgrimage to Aarhus "to see his peat-brown head." Heaney imagines himself standing "a long time" viewing the particulars of Tollund Man's preserved head and restored body. [Link to photo of Tollund Man] He then introduces the idea of ritual sacrifice, personifying and eroticising the bog as the goddess whose "dark juices" transform her bridegroom into "a saint's kept body."[^15]

Deciding whether to "risk blasphemy," by consecrating the bog as "holy ground" and praying to the Tollund Man, Heaney shifts from viewing the figure as an artifact and instead addresses him as a deity or saint with miraculous powers. His plea is for the Tollund Man to "make germinate" or revivify the bodies of four young brothers murdered in the 1920s by the Black and Tans. In contrast to the carefully exhibited body of the Tollund Man, these corpseswere "laid out in the farmyards," their bodies mutilated and scattered for "miles along the [railway] lines."[^16]

Remarkably, Heaney's recreation of this incident was also inspired by a photograph, as he explains in _Stepping Stones,_ "The 'Stockinged corpses/laid out in the farmyard' that appear in 'The Tollund Man', I first saw in a photograph in Tom Barry's book, _Guerilla Days in Ireland_. It was of a farmer's family who had been shot in reprisals by the Black and Tans, left lying on their backs beside their open door." (_SS_ 135) The disturbing photograph in question appears only in the 1949 edition of Barry's book and is not reprinted in later editions.[^17]

[Link to photo in Barry's book] It shows four unidentified bodies, their clothing in disarray, as Heaney remembered. The caption states that it was a "Photo in British Officer's captured album of West Cork I.R.A. men British had shot." Such albums were not uncommon in zones of conflict across the globe. The caption magnifies the original atrocity in its implication that the British officer's "captured album" displays photographs of such bodies as trophies of war. This photograph is deployed in two diametrically opposed contexts (a private photograph album and Barry's memoir) before finding a third context in Heaney's poem.


In the third section, it is the Tollund Man who is imagined briefly back to life, not as a saint, but in the vulnerable "sad freedom" of his final journey to his death. Collapsing the two time frames, Heaney concludes with a powerful identification of himself and the Tollund Man, past and present, ancient Denmark and modern Ireland, "Out there in Jutland/In the old man-killing parishes/I will feel lost,/Unhappy and at home." (_N_)

Heaney's paradoxical sense of familiarity and alienation in 'The Tollund Man' is made explicit in the companion poem, 'The Grauballe Man,' which employs a series of similes to translate the recovered body into poetic description. [Link to photo of the Grauballe Man] This poem is doubly ekphrastic in lines which reference Glob's book, "I first saw his twisted face/ in a photograph," and the Roman sculpture of "The Dying Gaul" evoked at the end of the poem. [Link to photo of Dying Gaul] The exhibited body[^18] is foregrounded in Heaney's highly aestheticized descriptions of each body part, exhuming the human shape from the organic and animal matter of the bog - "bog oak," "basalt egg," "swan's foot," and "swamp root". The poem's insistent similes focus attention on the body as object or artifact until the reader/viewer is abruptly questioned by the speaker: "​​Who will say 'corpse'/to his vivid cast?/Who will say 'body'/to his opaque repose?"(N, 29) Interrupting the meditative tone of the first half of the poem, these questions force the reader to consider the corporeality of the Grauballe Man, reborn in the second half of the poem as a "foetus" or "forceps baby." Finally, Heaney places his own act of aesthetic contemplation on the "scales/with beauty and atrocity," shockingly balancing and comparing the exhibited body of the Grauballe Man with 'the actual weight / of each hooded victim, / slashed and dumped' (N, 29) in contemporary Ireland.

[^15]: Include ref to Patricia Couglan and feminist critique here or in Punishment?

[^16]: These may be different bodies – see Parker pg 120 - Different account? "Part of the folklore where I grew up concerns four Catholic brothers massacred by Protestant paramilitaries. Their bodies had been trailed along the railway lines, over the sleepers as a kind of mutilation." (Ftnt pg 244 quotes SH giving a commentary on a selection of his poems on a Faber cassette tape from 1982)

[^18]: Giles claims that Glob normalised the display of bog bodies in Danish Museums - ​​As we have seen, Glob's strategic display of Grauballe Man in 1952 transformed not just public awareness of this phenomenon but normalised the display of human remains in Danish museums (Asingh and Lynnerup [2007](https://www.manchesteropenhive.com/view/9781526150196/9781526150196.00016.xml#ref-033)).
