                <p>“I have always listened for poems, they come sometimes like bodies come out of a bog, almost complete, seeming to have been laid down a long time ago, surfacing with a touch of mystery.” (‘Belfast,’ <em>P</em> 34)</p>
          <p>“They unswaddled the wet fern of her hair<br>
          And made an exhibition of its coil.” (‘Strange Fruit’)</p>
          <p>Seamus Heaney often said that he became a writer when his roots crossed with his reading, a casual example of the archaeological theme, accessible but multi-layered, that connects him to the earth as his natural element. The earliest reviews of his work describe how Heaney’s words give us “the soil-reek of Ireland,” <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> in poems “loud with the slap of the spade and sour with the stink of turned earth.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> Even the terms most often used to describe Heaney – ‘down to earth’ and ‘grounded’<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup> – evoke this element, as do Heaney’s own descriptions of his early poetry as “a dig for finds” (<em>P</em> 41), “earth-hugging” and “sedimentary”. [Link to photo of SH in bog]Heaney’s interest in his home ground expanded almost immediately from the local landscape, “Toner’s Bog in Bellaghy parish”(<em>SS</em> 98) to the matter of bogland in general to the “opened ground” of pre-Christian Europe. As Heaney said, “The material kept promising because of its intimacy with the very land that I grew up in. I could feel this in my nostrils, the feeling of a bog. And a lot of those poems…they come out of my intimacy with the bog as a domain…” <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>
          <p>From ‘Bogland’ through ‘The Tollund Man’ <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup> to the bog poems collected in <em>North</em>, Heaney extends his claim on the bog as his domain, staking out his poetic territory in material, mythological, and metaphorical terms. Indeed, he describes this period as one in which he was “treading earth” (<em>SS</em> 157) and later wrote, "Out of that earth-house, I inherited/A stack of singular cold memory-weights/To load me, hand and foot, in the scale of things.(‘Squarings xl’)"As he said of his devotion to the myth of Antaeus and Hercules in a speech delivered on RTE in celebration of his seventieth birthday [Integrate better]:</p>
          <p>In Greek mythology, Antaeus was a giant who was born out of the earth and who consequently derived all his strength and prowess from contact with the earth. . . I identified with this earthman because I saw myself as something of an earthman, somebody with his poetic feet very much on the local ground . . . I regarded Antaeus as something of a guardian spirit, an emblem of whatever poetic gift I might have. But at the same time I was also aware that Antaeus, for all his strength, was far from invulnerable; I knew indeed that he would be defeated in the end by another hero, the mighty Hercules.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup></p>
          <p>Heaney’s visceral, organic connection to the bog as his home ground and the galvanizing effect of Danish archaeologist, P.V. Glob’s book, <em>The Bog People</em> have rightly dominated discussions of this intensely fruitful turn in Heaney’s work.Inspired by Glob’s arresting photographs and descriptions of Iron age victims of ritual sacrifice, Heaney wrote a series of poems comparing these ancient acts of violence with current atrocities in the Northern Irish troubles.[Link to Glob photos] In these poems, the bog becomes not just an agent of preservation, yielding up indiscriminate objects, but a repository of human remains and the symbol of a savage history that refuses to remain buried.</p>
          <p>Focusing on two pairs of poems that engage with ancient bodies discovered in bogs in Northern Europe, I argue that the bog becomes for Heaney an underground museum or archive of a pre-Christian, pre-colonial past. In poems that juxtapose tribal sacrifice in ancient Jutland with acts of violence in contemporary Ireland, Heaney interrogates the ethics of viewing these human victims as they become museum pieces. In ‘The Tollund Man’, Heaney vows to visit the exhibited body in response to Glob’s photograph of the head in repose; ‘The Grauballe Man’ is doubly viewed as a photograph and museum piece and also compared to the Roman sculpture of the ‘Dying Gaul’. These male bodies, identified by the location in which they were found, set up the imagined continuity between ancient rituals of sacrifice to the fertility goddess, Nerthus, in Jutland and acts of atrocity in modern Ireland. Such violence is more explicitly rendered in two of the poems about female bodies, particularly ‘Punishment’, but also in its companion poem, ‘Strange Fruit’. These poems engage in written form with visual images of the bog bodies on display - either in photographs or in museums – and with the speaker’s own response to these exhibited human artifacts. In each case, moments of rupture occur when references to contemporary violence break through the speaker’s controlled aestheticized contemplation of the ancient bodies. In fact, it is through considering exhibition as a form of representation that the power of these poems to address violence in the past and present is revealed.</p>

          <p>Heaney’s poem ‘Bogland’ (<em>DD</em>, 55) initiates his exploration of the bog as “the memory of the landscape, or as a landscape that remember[s] everything that happened in and to it” (<em>P,</em> 54). [Link to draft of Bogland] The opening line, “We have no prairies/To slice a big sun at evening,” adopts a collective voice and opens a comparative vein (here, between Ireland and America) that will characterize all the bog poems. The viewpoint of the speaker and the gaze of the reader veers from the imagined horizon of the prairies intersecting the sun, down to the earth of the encrusted bog. As Heaney said, “I think that I am basically a ground person, you know, if it came to which element… I am sedimentary. That comes out earlier on, I think with poems like <em>Bog Land</em>, which is about going down and down and finding origin there.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup> Heaney, like the “pioneers,” he invokes in the poem, digs “inwards and downwards,” excavating the bog as a liquid landscape that preserves everything from the grandeur of the “great Irish elk” [Barrie Cooke painting]to the domesticity of butter sunk underground a hundred years ago. Heaney sees history as a palimpsest, incompletely erased and legible in the remembering ground of the bog itself. The poem’s pioneers are archaeologists of a landscape in which “Every layer they strip/Seems camped on before.” (<em>DD</em>, 55)</p>
          <p>Heaney dedicated ‘Bogland’ to his friend, the painter T.P. (Terry) Flanagan. Recalling a visit to the boglands of Donegal with his friend in 1968, Heaney contrasts their approaches to the bog as a landscape, “Terry was very much a visual, painterly reactor. I don’t think he had much politico-historico interest in it as an image”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup> Indeed, Flanagan’s bog paintings dwell on what Heaney called the “flirtation” of light and water on the surface of the landscape, mutating into abstract shapes and patterns. [<s>Link to Flanagan painting</s>] In contrast, Heaney is interested in the things that come out of the bog, from humble material objects to Viking gold to human remains. For Heaney, the bog is both repository and reliquary, “yielding” its treasures in material and creative terms.</p>
          <p>Recalling his sense of discovery when he began writing the first of his bog body poems, ‘The Tollund Man’ (<em>WO</em>, 47), Heaney said, “The minute I wrote ‘Some day I will go to Aarhus’ I was in a new field of force. It had to do with the aura surrounding that head – even in a photograph. It was uncanny in the full technical sense.” (SS pg? ) [Link to photo of Tollund Man head]In her discussion of Heaney and the photograph,Gail McConnell points out that Glob’s book has been considered primarily as a textual rather than visual source for Heaney’s bog poems, despite the fact that over half of the pages (64 out of 116) in <em>The Bog People</em> are photographs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup> She quotes Edna Longley’s observation that "many of Heaney’s comments on poetry ‘nudge it towards the visual arts . . . “the verbal icon”; “a search for images and symbols”; “The poetry I love is some kind of image or visionary thing”, “a painter can lift anything and make an image of it.”’<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup> Moving from the painterly to the photographic,Amanda Sperry<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup> emphasizes the mediated nature of Heaney’s engagement with the bog bodies in his poems, all (except ‘The Bog Queen’) reposing in museums in Northern Europe. However, what McConnell and Sperry describe as an encounter with photography and with photographic composition might also be described as a concern with “exhibition” or exposure and, ultimately, with the ethics of looking.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup> In fact, Melanie Giles opens her account of the bog bodies as “disquieting exhibits” with an epigraph from Heaney’s essay on ‘The Man and the Bog.’<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup></p>
          <p>Once upon a time, these heads and limbs existed in order to express and embody the needs and impulses of an individual human life. They were the vehicles of different biographies and they compelled singular attention, they proclaimed ‘I am I’. Even when they were first dead, at the moment of their sacrifice or atrocity, their bodies and their limbs manifested biography and conserved vestiges of personal identity: they were corpses. But when a corpse becomes a bog body, the personal identity drops away; the bog body does not proclaim ‘I am I’; instead it says something like ‘I am it’ or ‘I am you’. Like the work of art the bog body asks to be contemplated; it eludes the biographical and enters the realm of the aesthetic.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup></p>

                <p>The distances, temporal and geographical, between speaker and bog body in ‘The Tollund Man’ are tightly controlled by Heaney in what Helen Vendler calls a “binocular view of the past and present.” (Vendler, 42) The collective ‘we’ of ‘Bogland’ becomes the ‘I’ of Heaney’s personal vow to make a pilgrimage to Aarhus “to see his peat-brown head.” Heaney imagines himself standing “a long time” viewing the particulars of Tollund Man’s preserved head and restored body. [Link to photo of Tollund Man] He then introduces the idea of ritual sacrifice, personifying and eroticising the bog as the goddess whose “dark juices” transform her bridegroom into “a saint’s kept body.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
          <figure id="fig-tollund-man" class="q-figure q-figure--image">   <img alt="" class="q-figure__image" src="quire-seamus-heaney-elements-of-writing/_assets/images/figures/tollund-man.png" data-outputs-include="epub,pdf"> <figcaption class="q-figure__caption" data-outputs-include="epub,pdf"> <span class="q-figure__label q-figure__label--below"> <a class="q-figure__modal-link" href="#fig-tollund-man"><span class="q-figure__label-icon">  </span><span class="q-figure__label-text">Figure 1</span></a> </span> <span class="q-figure__caption-content">Tollund Man</span> <span class="q-figure__credit"></span> </figcaption> </figure>
          <p>Deciding whether to “risk blasphemy,” by consecrating the bog as “holy ground” and praying to the Tollund Man, Heaney shifts from viewing the figure as an artifact and instead addresses him as a deity or saint with miraculous powers. His plea is for the Tollund Man to “make germinate” or revivify the bodies of four young brothers murdered in the 1920s by the Black and Tans. In contrast to the carefully exhibited body of the Tollund Man, these corpseswere “laid out in the farmyards,” their bodies mutilated and scattered for “miles along the [railway] lines.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>
          <p>Remarkably, Heaney’s recreation of this incident was also inspired by a photograph, as he explains in <em>Stepping Stones,</em> “The ‘Stockinged corpses/laid out in the farmyard’ that appear in ‘The Tollund Man’, I first saw in a photograph in Tom Barry’s book, <em>Guerilla Days in Ireland</em>. It was of a farmer’s family who had been shot in reprisals by the Black and Tans, left lying on their backs beside their open door.” (<em>SS</em> 135) The disturbing photograph in question appears only in the 1949 edition of Barry’s book and is not reprinted in later editions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>
          <figure id="fig-barrys-book" class="q-figure q-figure--image">   <img alt="" class="q-figure__image" src="quire-seamus-heaney-elements-of-writing/_assets/images/figures/barrys-book.jpg" data-outputs-include="epub,pdf"> <figcaption class="q-figure__caption" data-outputs-include="epub,pdf"> <span class="q-figure__label q-figure__label--below"> <a class="q-figure__modal-link" href="#fig-barrys-book"><span class="q-figure__label-icon">  </span><span class="q-figure__label-text">Figure 2</span></a> </span> <span class="q-figure__caption-content">Barry’s Book</span> <span class="q-figure__credit"></span> </figcaption> </figure>
          <p>[Link to photo in Barry’s book] It shows four unidentified bodies, their clothing in disarray, as Heaney remembered. The caption states that it was a “Photo in British Officer’s captured album of West Cork I.R.A. men British had shot.” Such albums were not uncommon in zones of conflict across the globe. The caption magnifies the original atrocity in its implication that the British officer’s “captured album” displays photographs of such bodies as trophies of war. This photograph is deployed in two diametrically opposed contexts (a private photograph album and Barry’s memoir) before finding a third context in Heaney’s poem.</p>
          <p>In the third section, it is the Tollund Man who is imagined briefly back to life, not as a saint, but in the vulnerable “sad freedom” of his final journey to his death. Collapsing the two time frames, Heaney concludes with a powerful identification of himself and the Tollund Man, past and present, ancient Denmark and modern Ireland, “Out there in Jutland/In the old man-killing parishes/I will feel lost,/Unhappy and at home.” (<em>N</em>)</p>
          <p>Heaney’s paradoxical sense of familiarity and alienation in ‘The Tollund Man’ is made explicit in the companion poem, ‘The Grauballe Man,’ which employs a series of similes to translate the recovered body into poetic description. [Link to photo of the Grauballe Man] This poem is doubly ekphrastic in lines which reference Glob’s book, “I first saw his twisted face/ in a photograph,” and the Roman sculpture of “The Dying Gaul” evoked at the end of the poem. [Link to photo of Dying Gaul] The exhibited body<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup> is foregrounded in Heaney’s highly aestheticized descriptions of each body part, exhuming the human shape from the organic and animal matter of the bog - “bog oak,” “basalt egg,” “swan’s foot,” and “swamp root”. The poem’s insistent similes focus attention on the body as object or artifact until the reader/viewer is abruptly questioned by the speaker: “​​Who will say ‘corpse’/to his vivid cast?/Who will say ‘body’/to his opaque repose?”(N, 29) Interrupting the meditative tone of the first half of the poem, these questions force the reader to consider the corporeality of the Grauballe Man, reborn in the second half of the poem as a “foetus” or “forceps baby.” Finally, Heaney places his own act of aesthetic contemplation on the “scales/with beauty and atrocity,” shockingly balancing and comparing the exhibited body of the Grauballe Man with ‘the actual weight / of each hooded victim, / slashed and dumped’ (N, 29) in contemporary Ireland.

              <div class="content">
                <p><em>North</em> received the most controversial reviews of Heaney’s career; most focused on the bog poems, particularly ‘Punishment’.The volume was hailed by Conor Cruise O’Brien as listening to ‘the thing itself … the actual substance of historical agony and dissolution, the tragedy of a people in a place: the Catholics of Northern Ireland,’<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> and tendentiously reviewed in the <em>Honest Ulsterman</em> by Ciaran Carson who called Heaney ‘the laureate of violence – a mythmaker, an anthropologist of ritual killing, an apologist for “the situation”, in the last resort, a mystifier’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>
          <p>Carson and Edna Longley were foremost amongst the critics who questioned Heaney’s employment of Glob’s photographs of the Danish bog bodies to address contemporary violence in Northern Ireland.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>
          <p>‘Punishment’ (<em>N</em> 37-38) charts the speaker’s response to the exhumed body of a young girl (Windeby I), presumed by Glob to have been killed for committing adultery.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>
          <p>[Photo of Windeby Girl] Asked by O’Driscoll if he had kept Glob’s book open in front of him as he wrote the poems, Heaney replies that "There were a few of them—“Bog Queen” and “Punishment,” in particular—where the information and speculation in the text were vital elements. (SS pg?)O’Driscoll follows up by asking ifthe difficulty with ‘Punishment’ was “more political than literary?” Heaney replies, “That’s not how I would put it, because that makes it sound as if I were “addressing the situation in Northern Ireland.” Admittedly I “addressed the situation” when I introduced different bog poems at readings and so on, although I now realize that it would have been better for the poems and for me and for everybody else if I had left them without that sort of commentary… (SS 157-159)” In Glob’s description, the girl’s head had been shaved, a blindfold placed on her eyes, and her body weighed down in the bog with branches and a large stone. He imagined her being “led naked out onto the bog with bandaged eyes . . . and drowned in the little peat pit, which must have held twenty inches of water or more.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup> Many of these details remain in the vivid recreation of her punishment in the poem as the speaker actively places himself at the scene of her murder before imagining the girl back to life. His complex response to this eroticised female victim ranges from empathy (‘I can feel the tug / of the halter’), to visualization (‘I can see her drowned / body’), to tenderness (‘Little adulteress’), to intimacy (‘My poor scapegoat, / I almost love you’) (<em>N</em> 37-38).</p>
          <p>The uneasy conflict between tribal loyalties and personal intimacy suggested by this juxtaposition of ‘scapegoat’ and ‘almost-love’ is furthered by Heaney’s introduction of the biblical story of the woman condemned for adultery in the Christian Gospel of St. John. When the speaker declares that he “would have cast . . . the stones of silence,” he evokes Christ’s words to the crowd gathered to stone the woman, “He that is without sin among you. Let him first cast a stone at her. (John 8:7)” The biblical crowd disperses but Heaney’s speaker accuses himself of a more complex crime, implying that his inaction or silence renders him just as culpable as the vengeful spectators. He compounds this sense of complicity with the self-recriminatory line, ‘I am the artful voyeur / of your brain’s exposed / and darkened combs’ (<em>N</em> 38). Here Heaney confronts the queasy sense of covert sexual pleasure implicit in his earlier descriptions of the girl’s frail naked body and exposed nipples. Is his voyeurism more or less reprehensible if it is in the service of ‘art’, if the nipples are described as “amber beads”? Is such scrutiny more or less objectionable when his gaze shifts from her sexualised body to her exposed brain, muscles and “numbered bones”? In viewing the body of the girl, Heaney also records her transformation from ancient corpse to exhibit or aesthetic object. Her “numbered bones”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup> evoke the classification systems of both forensic analysis (of crime scenes) and museums, conflating the violent context of her death with her cultural afterlife.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup></p>
          <p>Most of the negative critical attention focused on the last two stanzas of the poem in which Heaney compares the ritual killing of the ancient ‘little adulteress’ with the tarring and feathering of women who became involved with British soldiers in 1970s Northern Ireland, “I who have stood dumb/when your betraying sisters,/cauled in tar,/wept by the railings.” (<em>N</em> 38). In this jolt from the Iron Age to the contemporary period, Heaney undercuts the idea that ‘standing dumb’ or ‘bystanding’ is somehow a neutral or dispassionate act. This is the most shocking of the contemporary acts of atrocity evoked in these poems, partly because the speaker seems to have actually witnessed the tarring and feathering of these women and is calibrating his response in real time. The equivalent moment in ‘The Grauballe Man’ occurs at the end of the poem when Heaney places the “actual weight/of each hooded victim/slashed and dumped” on the scales of “beauty and atrocity.” (<em>N</em> ) Although this is a jarring reminder of the ugliness of ‘actual’ violence as opposed to the “too strictly compassed” work of art, the metaphoric scales consign these victims to a more abstract realm than the ‘railings’ of ‘Punishment.’ While it is highly unlikely that Heaney himself stood by the railings and witnessed one of these horrifying acts of brutality, the impression of immediacy is substantiated by the discovery of a newspaper cutting among his working papers showing one such victim.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup></p>
          <p>[Link to cutting]There were several accounts of these violent acts against women published in the months in which Heaney worked on the poem and it is unclear which newspaper carried this photograph.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup> As a result, the girl in the newspaper photograph remains anonymous, and she also becomes one of several “betraying sisters” rather than a singular figure mirroring the tenderly evoked “little adulteress” from the ancient past.</p>
          <p>In an interview with Henri Cole in the <em>Paris Review</em> in 1997, Heaney talks about the “element of self-accusation, which makes the poem personal in a fairly acute way,” and adds yet another unseen context to his discussion of the poem, “It’s a poem about standing by as the IRA tar and feather these young women in Ulster. But it’s also about standing by as the British torture people in barracks and interrogation centres in Belfast. About standing between those two forms of affront.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup></p>
          <p>Twenty years after the poem’s publication, Heaney here seems to want to redress the balance of accusations about ‘barbaric’ and ‘civilized’ forms of torture, echoing the contentious lines addressed to Tacitus in ‘Kinship,’ “Read the inhumed faces/of casualty and victim; report us fairly,/how we slaughter/for the common good.” (<em>N</em> )</p>
          <p>The three time frames of ‘Punishment’ – pagan/anthropological, Christian/religious, and modern/political – stage Heaney’s ethical dilemma about his own artistic practice and his personal culpability. Heaney’s use of these framing devices is further illuminated by examining the drafts of the poem which show many variations in form, style, and time period during the process of composition.</p>
          <p>DRAFTS: [Digital display]</p>
          <p>While the drafts show that the opening stanzas of the poem remain largely unchanged, one version experiments with the sonnet form, another reveals the alternative title, ‘Shame,’<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup> but gradually the lines become shorter and the poem lengthens into its final form. These drafts also depict how Heaney wrestled with some of the poem’s most striking lines about the complicity of the speaker with those who would condemn and punish the girl. The earliest versions include references to “Senate and althing,” the abstract officialdom of the state personified in the figure of the “groomed proconsul” whose “civilized disdain for you and yours” is measured against the “tribe’s exact and intimate revenge”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup> Heaney here conflates pagan and Christian time frames and, with the speaker, claims that “all might cast the stones of silence” in condemnation of the girl. Significantly, in changing “We all might cast,” to “I would have cast, I know,” he places himself in the dock and no longer outsources judgement to official sources.</p>
          <p>The body of the girl, like the Christ-like Tollund Man, is initially revered by the speaker as he imagines observing the spectacle of its public display. However, Heaney gradually erases religious references from the poem including words and phrases such as “atoning,” “soiled halo,” “scourge,” “rend my garments, as if without sin,” and “palm leaf.” In removing this language, Heaney desacralizes the body and restores her flawed humanity to the long-dead girl.</p>
          <p>Indeed, the shift in the relationship between the speaker and the girl evoked in the self-accusatory line, ‘I am the artful voyeur /of your brain’s exposed /and darkened combs’ (<em>N</em> 38) follows several revealing drafts of the poem in which the speaker accuses himself of being a ‘cowardly spy’ and a ‘posthumous collaborator’ in her punishment. The word ‘collaborator’ has a particular resonance in this context since the public shaming of women by tarring and feathering them was associated not only with perceived sexual betrayal, but also with informing or collaborating with the British army or police force. Indeed, another possible source for Heaney’s poem is a photograph published in the <em>Listener</em> in May 1972, of a 15 year old girl, beaten, tarred, and feathered by the Official IRA for “providing info to the RUC Special Branch.” (NSS, 190). Thus, while the presumed adultery of the Windeby Girl aligns with the sexual policing of her “betraying sisters,” other forms of betrayal and other forms of surveillance are also at stake. The charge of collaboration in the drafts is a free-floating accusation that moves between the speaker and the girl but is absent in the poem’s final form. Instead, Heaney focuses on the speaker’s personal moral position, using the verb “connive” rather than “collaborate,” and problematizes the idea of his “civilised outrage” while claiming to “understand” the community or tribe of tormentors validating this “intimate revenge”.</p>
          <p>Nathan Suhr-Sytsma usefully complicates the vexed question of whether Heaney (in the guise of his speaker) legitimizes the violence meted out to these women by suggestingthat the poem might “be less about condoning ‘intimate revenge’ than about the speaker’s discomfort with assuming a position of journalistic impersonality from which to condemn such revenge, a discomfort with the “cowardly spy” who reports on the death of those tarred and feathered during the Troubles as opposed to the “artful voyeur” who attempts to understand that he himself is an observer of this predicament” (Suhr-Sytsma 193). Certainly, in the final version of ‘Punishment,’ the ambiguity of ‘artful’ combined with ‘voyeur’ resonates throughout the poem and beyond as Heaney weighs up his own role as culpable bystander and as tribal witness.</p>

                <p>One further stanza found in the drafts of ‘Punishment,’ powerfully connects the two female bog bodies under discussion here. In an excised stanza, Heaney writes:</p>
          <p>Into your meek gaze</p>
          <p>I commit the stone-casters</p>
          <p>And your punished sisters</p>
          <p>Weeping under the lamp-post. [Link to Haydon Murphy Broadsheet]</p>
          <p>Echoing the lines spoken by Christ <em>in extremis</em>, “Father, into your hands, I commit my spirit,” Heaney here consigns the perpetrators and the punished into the “meek gaze” of the ancient</p>
          <p>girl.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
          <p>Heaney deletes this stanza from ‘Punishment’ but the concept of the gaze becomes the central trope of the next poem in <em>North</em>, ‘Strange Fruit’ (<em>N</em> 32_)_. At first, this sonnet seems to retreat from any contemporary context back into the museum with the explicit language of display, “Here is the girl’s head like an exhumed gourd”. [Link to Glob Photo]Organic similes, like those used in the ‘The Grauballe Man’, vie with descriptions of the head as a valuable object, “perishable treasure” that will literally be “made an exhibition of”. In the octet, the girl’s head is viewed and forensically examined by the speaker, but she does not look back – even her eyeholes are described as “blank as pools in the old workings.” [Link to Toome print]</p>
          <p>The proximity between the speaker and the girl is displaced in the sestet by the broader historical context of her murder, recording “the gradual ease” of Greek historian, Diodorus Siculus with “the likes of this.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> The estrangement promised by the title comes not by considering the barbaric circumstances of the girl’s death, but in the speaker’s awareness of his own tendency to worship her severed head. The relentless list of adjectives describing her plight, “Murdered, forgotten, nameless, terrible/Beheaded girl,” are laid before her, as if in atonement, but fall short before her restored gaze. Repeating the word “outstaring,” Heaney grants the girl the power to challenge the violence of her executioners and the devotion offered by the poet-speaker in his artful transformation of her fate. These lines adjust the problematic male gaze or voyeurism of ‘Punishment’ to allow for the silent rebuke of this unseeing female stare, “outstaring axe/And beatification, outstaring/What had begun to feel like reverence.” Helen Vendler describes this (uncanny) encounter like “an uninterpretable residue or some other form of art beyond mimetic representation,” (Vendler, pg 48) suggesting the unsettling effect of the girl’s gaze on the speaker and the reader. Unsettling too is the interjection of the contemporary context of the poem’s title, ‘Strange Fruit,’ into this poetic contemplation of the ancient body.</p>
          <p>This title conjures up the lynched black bodies hanging from the ‘southern trees’ of Abel Meeropol’s song ‘Strange Fruit’ made famous by Billie Holiday in 1939. In her examination of the drafts of the poem, Gail McConnell points out that Meeropol himself had been ‘haunted for days’ by a photograph of a lynching<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup> in which the bodies of two black men hang from trees above a crowd of white spectators. (McConnell, 432). This is the only one of the bog poems to evoke a contemporary comparative framework outside of Ireland and the only one to suggest racialized (as opposed to gender) violence.</p>
          <p>The manuscript drafts of the poem show that the poem was originally entitled ‘Triceps’, then ‘Reliquary’, then ‘My Reverence’ and seemingly finally, ‘Tête coupée’.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup><br>
          [link to drafts]</p>
          <p>In composing the poem, Heaney gradually removes specific references to Catholic relics and beliefs; Oliver Plunkett<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>, the martyr whose head is on display in St. Peter’s Church in Drogheda [link to photo]; “Veronica’s napkin,” the cloth relic named after the woman who wiped the face of Jesus as he carried the cross; “exposition,” in which the girl’s head functions as a synecdoche for the body of Christ. These Catholic relics are relegated from the drafts alongside references to earlier pre-Christian or Celtic practices as Heaney tightens his focus on the severed head itself and the unseeing stare of the beheaded girl. The religious residue remains however in the working titles, ‘Reliquary,’ and ‘My Reverence,’ the latter foregrounding the worshipful attitude of the speaker. McConnell rightly argues that such changes reveal Heaney’s attempt to “get at the complex politics of the gaze and the ethics of looking. (McConnell, 435)” Certainly, the final title change – shown in a decisive black line striking through ‘Tête coupée’ and its replacement by the capitalized, handwritten ‘STRANGE FRUIT’ – opens up an entirely new field of force and of situational politics. [link to draft] Yet, perhaps because the implied comparison of the ancient head or “exhumed gourd” to the “strange fruit” of black bodies murdered in the early twentieth-century is confined to the title of the poem, it has not attracted the kind of criticism levelled at ‘Punishment.’ Instead, the critics of ‘Punishment’ read ‘Strange Fruit’ as one of the most successful poems in <em>North</em>, because in Edna Longley’s words, “it questions its own attitude, challenges inevitability.” (Longley, 155) Despite her exposure in this poem, the unseeing blank-eyed girl, like the blindfolded figure of Justice, “outstares” the totalizing gaze of the speaker, the reader and the museum visitor and refuses the categories of this “exhibition.”</p>

                <p>Much attention has been paid to Heaney’s own commentary on the political context of the bog poems and on their relevance to the violence of the 1970s. In one of his earliest interviews in 1977, Heaney talked about how his poetic “instinctive energies” were more engaged by the images in Glob’s book than by the atrocities happening outside his own front door:</p>
          <p>My emotions, my feelings, whatever those instinctive energies are that have to be engaged for a poem, those energies quickened more when contemplating a victim, strangely, from 2000 years ago than they did from contemplating a man at the end of a road being swept up into a plastic bag – I mean the barman at the end of our road tried to carry out a bomb and it blew up. Now there is of course something terrible about that, but somehow language, words didn’t live in the way I think they have to live in a poem when they were hovering over that kind of horror and pity.<br>
          <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
          <p>For the most part, critics have followed Heaney’s lead in looking away from the contemporary violence at the ancient victims recovered from the bog and revivified in his poems. Yet this statement is most notable for the way it registers the shock of the local barman “being swept up into a plastic bag.”<br>
          <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup><br>
          All the energy in the passage is about the horror of the contemporary incident, not the 2000 year old bodies. Notably, in early drafts of ‘Funeral Rites’ from <em>North,</em> Heaney includes much more explicit references to “men whose blown stomachs were cleaned like dung/into eight plastic bags” (Version 1), “men whose blown stomachs were cleaned like dung/Off the pavements” (Version 2), and “shovelled remnants” (Version 3)<br>
          <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup><br>
          but as Michael Parker points out, the final version of the poem directs “its metaphoric and mythic energies towards some future rituals of atonement and reconciliation.”<br>
          <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>
          <p>In fact, this particular incident became something of a trigger for Heaney, appearing in several early interviews and finally in the elegiac poem ‘Route 110,’ from his last volume, <em>Human Chain</em>, “And what in the end was there left to bury/Of Mr. Lavery, blown up in his own pub/As he bore the primed device and bears it still/Mid-morning towards the sun-admitting door/Of Ashley House?” (<em>HC</em>) The endless time-loop of Mr Lavery carrying the primed device in his last moments (“and bears it still”) recurs as a traumatic memory for Heaney.</p>
          <p>The incident is first mentioned in a piece by Bernard Weinraur in the <em>New York Times</em> in May 1972 called “Belfast: Terror in a Time of Troubles.”<br>

          The article opens with a description of the recent explosion of a 100 pound bomb and the response of various figures in Belfast associated with the arts and culture including Seamus Heaney, “the city’s best-known poet,” who heard the blast and “looked up from his desk.” In the piece, Heaney describes Northern Ireland as an “anachronistic and primitive place with tremendous ritual and delicate taboos,” a place in which the troubles have “formed people’s personalities and psychologies”. Asked more specifically about how to respond to the violence, Heaney replied, "When I write it’s not to heal the situation, but myself. What I want to do is explore, rather than propound. I want to tell my own secrets."He goes on to discuss the death of the barman on his street, “A man was blown to pieces on the corner recently,” [Heaney] said. “You want to do something, say something, but you feel impotent. I wrote a poem about lying awake at night and listening to the bombs. But, you see, I’m interested in memories, intimacies.” Even here, speaking to a journalist in the midst of the terror, Heaney’s instinct is to deflect attention away from the specificities and to guard his right to his interior life and poetic subject matter.</p>
          <p>In contrast, Heaney’s description of the importance of Glob’s book in his first major critical essay, ‘Feeling into Words,’ is much more controlled, “And the unforgettable photographs of these victims blended in my mind with photographs of atrocities, past and present, in the long rites of Irish political and religious struggles”. (<em>P</em> 57-8) The bog poems not only “blend” these photographic images into poetic language but also displace and distance the atrocities Heaney witnesses outside his own front door. Again, discussing the most controversial bog poem, ‘Punishment,’ in 1997, Heaney says, “Its concerns are immediate and contemporary, but for some reason I couldn’t bring army barracks or police barracks or Bogside street life into the language and topography of the poem. I found it more convincing to write about the bodies in the bog and the vision of Iron Age punishment. Pressure seemed to drain away from the writing if I shifted my focus from those images.”<br>
          <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup><br>
          Despite Heaney’s insistence on his personal aesthetic need to ‘take his distance’ from the immediate situation, his critics accused him of mythologising or aestheticising violence.</p>
          <p>This critique was most forcefully voiced by Ciaran Carson in his review of <em>North</em> in <em>The Honest Ulsterman</em> in 1975, in which he claimed that Heaney was in danger of becoming ‘the laureate of violence – a mythmaker, an anthropologist of ritual killing, an apologist for “the situation”, in the last resort, a mystifier’.<br>
          <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup><br>
          [Link to Carson review]This indictment obscures another scathing comment in the same review, “[e]veryone was anxious that <em>North</em> should be a great book; when it turned out that it wasn’t, it was treated as one anyway, and made into an Ulster '75 Exhibition of the Good that can come out of Troubled Times.” Together with his assessment of Edward McGuire’s portrait of Heaney [link to portrait] on the back cover of <em>North</em> as “idealized almost to the point of caricature,” and his contention that Heaney has “acquired the status of myth, of institution,” Carson’s ‘Ulster ‘75 Exhibition’ showcases Heaney himself as the prime exhibit on display. What Heaney ‘represents’ is harder to gauge although the final quip that "Heaney is too good and too sensible a poet to turn into Faber’s answer to Georgie Best’’ suggests that Carson’s objections have as much to do with the marketing and commercialisation of Heaney as the representative poet of the Troubles as with the poems under review. Carson recoils from the idea that the suffering caused by the Troubles might be repackaged as poetry that is redemptive or consolatory by Heaney’s London-based publishing firm, a concern shared by Heaney in his own rejection of “the good news brigade” and the question posed in ‘Stump,’ “What do I say if they wheel out their dead?”(WO)</p>
          <p>Carson’s acerbic invention of an exhibition of “the Good that can come out of Troubled Times,” speaks to the earlier line in his review in which he claims that Heaney is in danger of becoming the"laureate of violence." This anxiety about the representation of the Troubles (shared by many if not all of Carson’s fellow poets) is of course discernible in the bog poems themselves, often in language that interrogates the problems of exhibiting or exposing these ancient bodies.</p>

                <p>Paradoxically, earth is the most familiar element for SH - describes himself as sedimentary – and yet it is the element that provides the most effective distancing mechanism for confronting the difficult material of the Troubles and his own times. The process of unearthing poems (and buried bodies) mirrors his creative process and his self-refective engagement with this archaeological impulse. “Digging deep” opens a pathway to complex layers of history and of the self for Heaney as he navigates the parallels be finds between ancient rituals of tribal sacrifice and the brutal violence of contemporary times…</p>
          <p>[“Summer 1969”: Include discussion of Goya? See RL on this poem</p>
          <p>The final image is that of “that holmgang / Where two berserks club each other to death / For honour’s sake, greaved in a bog, and sinking”. These complex and powerful images allude to the cycle of death, revenge, and violence that is going on in Northern Ireland at the time that Heaney was in Spain. ]</p>
